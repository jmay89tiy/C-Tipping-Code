# C-Tipping-Code
A simple program designed to take standard input and output for tipping 
You are prompted for how much you would like to tip, then you compile using "g++ tip.cpp" and run the program using "./a.out"
The computer must compile the C++ I have written so that it can understand how to interpret the information so that the computer can carry out my tasks I have instructed it to complete. 

The end result: 
You will be prompted to enter a tip and it will confirm how much you tipped, then it will thank you for tipping! I will add an alternate message for non tippers in the future.  

Very simple and straightforward as I learn to navigate and teach myself C++ for the first time.
