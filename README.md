# C-Tipping-Code
A simple program designed to take standard input and output for tipping 
You are prompted for how much you would like to tip, then you compile using "g++ tip.cpp" and "./a.out"
You will be prompted to enter a tip and it will confirm how much you tipped. 

Very simple and straightforward as I learn to navigate and use C++ for the first time.
